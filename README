DBIx::Class::Sugar

My attempt at adding sugar layer over querying DBIx::Class, Its at a very alpha stage.

  use DBIx::Class::Sugar;

  schema $schema;

  # from can be passed 'table' OR result source name
  my $rs = all from 'employee';

  # same as above
  my $rs = select '*' 
    => from 'employee';

  #
  my $rs = select [ qw/id name dob/ ]
    => from 'employee';

  # 
  $rs = select '*'
    => from 'employee' 
    => where $sqlt_clause
    => order [ ]
    => limit 10;
